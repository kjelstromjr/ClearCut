ClearCut is a simple program built in c that replaces the background of all images to a transparent one in the directory it is run in.


## Deployment

For now, users must download the executable files from the releases or compile the code on their machine. The program can be added to the PATH of the machine so that it can be run from anywhere.

Package deployment is currently under development
